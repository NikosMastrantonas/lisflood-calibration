# NOTES:
# min_gen = Run at least this number of generations.
# max_gen = Maximum number of generations to run, used as failsafe stop criterion. Takes precedence over minGen (handy for fast debugging)
# mu = # of best children chosen to feed into the next generation (JRC decided to make it 2x calibration parameters)
#      This must always be at least 2, otherwhise DEAP cannot crossover-mutate the children
# Lamda = # of children spawned at every generation (= # threads to run in parallel)
#         This must always be twice mu
